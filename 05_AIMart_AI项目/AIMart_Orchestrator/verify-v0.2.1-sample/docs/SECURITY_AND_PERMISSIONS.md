Commands marked queue_for_approval must be written to runtime/APPROVAL_QUEUE.md before execution.
Commands marked deny must not be executed.

## Autonomous Mode Policy

- Read runtime/SAFE_COMMANDS.md before running automated commands.
- Read runtime/DENIED_COMMANDS.md before queueing or denying high-risk work.
- Read runtime/AUTONOMOUS_EXECUTION_POLICY.md before unattended runs.
- View logs under .aimart/logs after supervised or autonomous Codex sessions.
- Use agent_adapters/codex/run-codex-unified-autonomous.* when you want the one-window autonomous runner with runtime/AUTONOMOUS_RUN_STATUS.md and runtime/AUTONOMOUS_RUN_SUMMARY.md updates.
- Use runtime/APPROVAL_QUEUE.md for blocked or high-risk actions; Autonomous Mode should continue with safe independent tasks when possible.
